### Instruction:

-  **How to run the project?** Run the jar file using the command 
> java -jar .\out\artifacts\java_youtube_oop_project_jar\java-youtube-oop-project.jar

or use dedicated java IDE (remember to set src folder as the source folder).

- **How to start the simulation?** Select the number of users and channels in the setup dialog. I recommend choosing around 10 of each, for the sake of convienience (graphical interface is not meant to handle enormous amounts of users, although the program could do that). 

- **What is going on?** Important events like start of a stream or a new video being added are mentioned in the user's terminal. These actions may be spectated using the GUI - including teh details of all major entities (UserAccounts, Channels, Videos, Streams), by choosing a particular user and pressing a desired button. 

- **How does the serialization work in this project?** Saving and loading a state are realized, respectively, by the serialization and deserialization techniques. Saved states will immidiately appear in the outer-most directory of the project. In order to use "Load" function, one has to put "simulationManager.ser" (name matters in this case) file in the java-youtube-oop-project directory and press the "Load" button while in the simulation.

- **Documentation?** For documentation, please go to javadoc folder and choose package-summary.html file.
